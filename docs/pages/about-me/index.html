                    <p class="body-text">
                        I have been interested in computers since I was elementary school. 
                        I was fascinated by how people could make and share software, to do whatever they want it to do.
                        When I was in middle school, I started learning my first programming language Python and made my own simple game. 
                        In my game the user would imput a number to choose between multiple different options with results of their choices described in text.
                    </p>

                    <p class="body-text">
                        Later, I learned about more advanced programming languages like Java. 
                        I explored what I could do using different programming langues, working on small projects in my free time.
                        Finishing highschool, with my interest in coding, I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science. 
                        Furthering my own understanding, and ability by learning more about computer science, not just coding in general.
